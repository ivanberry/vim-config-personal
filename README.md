This is a backup file of my personal vim config
And it includes the basic configs of vim in the file .vimrc
also including two plugin:
Ths first one is emmet,and it is a easy tool to write the HTML/CSS
the another is the NERDTree,just like its name ,it can make the file display like trees,and that's usefull.
